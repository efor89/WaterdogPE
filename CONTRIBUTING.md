# Contributor guide

## How to find something to PR
Want to contribute to the project, but don't know how? Take a look into the Issues section of the project, and see if there are some sitting around that you like. But check first whether there is already a PR for that issue (usually linked underneath the issue).
PRs can also contain additions to docs / code docs, or other informative no-code documents in the project. 

## Contribution Basics
If you want to contribute to the project, that is easily possible. To contribute, simply fork this repository, make the changes you want to make, then create a pull request targetting this repository again.

## Branching
If you have written your code, please *do not target release branch*. Target the master branch with your PR, its the main development branch between releases.

## PR Descriptions
Try to describe your changes in your PR description. Explain what you changed, why you changed it, and how it affects the API and plugins (Backwards-Compatible..).

## Review
When your PR is up, we (the project maintainers) will review it. It will take at least one Maintainer review to get your pull request merged. You may be asked to make changes.

## PR is merged
Congratulations, your PR got merged! You are now officially a contributor to the project.
If you contribute to the project, feel free to ping a Maintainer on Discord to receive the Contributor role on the Discord Server.
